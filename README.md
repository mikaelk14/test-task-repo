TASK
=======
# Overview:
To make 2 services(spring-boot), which do the following tasks:
### Service 1:
On getting `HTTP-GET` request(any endpoint)
- Forms a byte array, consisting of 200-kilobyte random data
- Puts the array into Redis
### Service 2:
- Takes the array from redis
- Forms a digital signature depending on array data using algorithm ECDSA
- Puts the digital signature in Redis
### Service 1:
- Takes the digital signature from Redis
- Checks if it is correct
- Returns the result of checking in answer for `HTTP GET` request
## Additional terms:
- After checking the digital signature there is no need to contain data in Redis anymore
- Keys and signatures can be fixed-value objects, but there still should be a function for their generation
- Response should contain a correct **JSON-object**, even if an exception was thrown
  Prerequisites
-----------
* Installed Java JDK 17
* Installed Maven
* Installed Docker

  How to run application locally through a terminal
------------
1. Clone the project from a repository from GitHub \
   With SSH\
   [git@github.com:mikaelk14/test-task-repository.git](git@github.com:mikaelk14/test-task-repository.git) \
   or with HTTPS\
   [https://github.com/mikaelk14/test-task-repository.git](https://github.com/mikaelk14/test-task-repository.git)
2. Open a terminal ad ``cd`` to the main folder - it's a parent folder for models
3. Go to required model's folder and run a maven script ``mvn sprin-boot:run``
4. Send a ``GET`` request to `localhost:8080/api/v1/message` and get response from

3. Go to required model's folder and run a maven script ``docker-compose up --build --detach``.\
   You could use ``--force-recreate`` if needed
